    Call this in either of two cases:

    - Before creating a dataset, so that ingestion embeds with ``embedder``. This
      draws on the capabilities for the data being added, such as embedding images,
      image crops, or videos.
    - Before starting the GUI, so that search embeds queries with ``embedder``. This
      draws on the capabilities for the query kinds, such as embedding text, or
      images for reverse-image search. Search resolves the embedder by the collection's
      stored embedding space, so ``embedder`` must share that space to take effect.

    Args:
        embedder: The embedder to register. Its embedding space is read from
            ``embedder.embedding_space_spec()``.
        for_capabilities: Capabilities for which this embedder becomes the default choice.
            By default, all implemented capabilities are updated. An empty set registers
            the embedder without changing the defaults. Requested capabilities the
            embedder does not implement are ignored.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the embedder implements no capability, or if it shares a space
            with an embedder the registry already holds but does not match its spec.
